# point of this program is to organize and store your password so we gonna store all the passwords along with username of the account they are associated with any text file but we are not going to store the password in plane text but we are going to encrypt the password .
# Now, even though we are encrypting these passwords which means they are going to need a kind of password to be able to decrypt them.
# So its like a master password for all the passwords.
# Also this is not a secure way of storing your passwords do no rely on this other then just a python project.

# First thing: We gonna write the code thats allowing us to actually ask the user whether they want to list out there passwords or whether they want to add a new one
# so we gonna store all of these in a text file 

# ask the user for master passwords
